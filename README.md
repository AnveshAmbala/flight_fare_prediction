## Overview üåê
This is a Flask web app that predicts the fare of flight tickets.

## Motivation üöÄ
What to do when you are at home during this pandemic situation? I started learning Machine Learning models to make the most out of it. Understanding the mathematics behind all supervised models led me to realize the importance of working on real-world applications to make a difference.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
The code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed, you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python, you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
